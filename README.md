# Author

I developed this project because I'm learning about data analytics and is a very interesting build chart on #COVID-19 because it helps to stay updated with the world.

P.S: At this moment I'm developing other charts if you want see any chart you can open an issue to talk about it.

Thanks and stay safe.
